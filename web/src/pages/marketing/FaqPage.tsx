  {
    question: 'Do my customers need to install anything?',
    answer:
      "No. They message your existing WhatsApp Business number the way they always have. OrderFlow answers on your behalf, shows the menu and takes the order — there's no app to download and nothing for them to sign up for.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need a Meta WhatsApp Business API account?',
    answer:
      'Yes — OrderFlow connects to your WhatsApp number through the official Meta WhatsApp Cloud API, so your account stays in good standing with Meta. Once your account is set up, connecting it to OrderFlow takes a few minutes from Settings.',
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I go over my plan's order limit?",
    answer:
      "We'll let you know from the dashboard as you approach your limit. Orders already placed are never blocked — you can upgrade at any time from Settings and the new limit applies immediately.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I change plans later?',
    answer:
      'Yes, at any time from Settings. Downgrading to Free applies immediately; moving to a paid plan will be available once card payments are enabled for your region.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my business data shared with other merchants?',
    answer:
      'No. Every business on OrderFlow is fully isolated — your products, orders and customers are only ever visible to your own team.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What currency am I billed in?',
    answer:
      'Plan prices are in USD. You can still sell to your own customers in whatever currency you set in Settings — the two are independent.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which countries is OrderFlow available in?',
    answer:
      "OrderFlow is built for shops across Ghana and West Africa, and works anywhere Meta's WhatsApp Cloud API is available.",
  },
